# 🧨 gesture-driven-3d-cube

> Real-time hand-tracked 3D cube manipulation using OpenCV and MediaPipe — built by [Aditya Kumar](https://github.com/ddityakumar-work-456)

This project showcases a gesture-controlled, interactive 3D cube using just a webcam and your hands. With pinch and two-hand gestures, you can **pick**, **move**, **rotate**, and **scale** a 3D cube — simulating futuristic object control like in Iron Man’s UI.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **OpenCV** for video capture & rendering
* **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking
* **NumPy** for math operations
* **OOP Design** for maintainable architecture
